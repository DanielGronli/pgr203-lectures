# PGR203 Advanced Java

Welcome to this course in Advanced Java. In this course you will learn the skills necessary for backend programming with Java. You will learn about programming skills such as test-driven development, pair programming and continuous integration; you will learn about programming tools such as IntelliJ, Maven and Github and you will learn about technologies such as Sockets, HTTP, JDBC and PostgreSQL.

The class will be taught through live programming, exercises and assignments. This Github repository contains commit logs for the live programming lectures that you can follow along to complete the exercises.
