# Learning Test-Driven Development with Minesweeper

Example input:

    .....
    .....
    *....
    .*...
    ..*..

Example output

    00000
    11000
    *2100
    2*210
    12*10

During this lecture, we will demonstrate pair programming and test driven development

## Steps

1. [x] Create project
2. [ ] Write failing test for super simple minefield. See it fail. Commit
3. [ ] Switch programmer - write super simple implementation. See it succeed. Commit
4. [ ] Write next test - change the dimensions of the minefield. See it fail. Commit
5. [ ] Switch programmer. Make the test pass. Commit
6. [ ] Write next test. See it fail. Commit

## Test progression

* [ ] Small, empty minefield
* [ ] Empty minefield with different height
* [ ] Empty minefield with different width
* [ ] Filled minefield (all mines)
* [ ] 2x1 minefield with a mine
* [ ] 3x1 minefield with a mine in the middle
* [ ] 1x2 minefield with a mine
* [ ] 1x3 minefield with a mine in the middle
* [ ] 3x3 minefield with a mine in the middle
* [ ] 3x3 minefield with some mines
