# Learning Test-Driven Development with Minesweeper

Example input:

    .....
    .....
    *....
    .*...
    ..*..

Example output

    00000
    11000
    *2100
    2*210
    12*10

During this lecture, we will demonstrate pair programming and test driven development

## Steps

1. [x] Create project
2. [x] Write failing test for super simple minefield. See it fail. Commit
3. [x] Switch programmer - write super simple implementation. See it succeed. Commit
4. [x] Write next test - change the dimensions of the minefield. See it fail. Commit
5. [x] Switch programmer. Make the test pass. Commit
6. [x] Write next test. See it fail. Commit

## Test progression

* [x] Small, empty minefield
* [x] Empty minefield with different height
* [x] Empty minefield with different width
* [x] Filled minefield (all mines)
* [x] 2x1 minefield with a mine
* [x] 5x1 minefield with a mine in the middle
* [x] 1x5 minefield with a mine in the middle
* [x] 3x3 minefield with a mine in the middle
* [x] 3x3 minefield with some mines
* [x] A complete example
